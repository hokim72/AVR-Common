// This byte-buffer structure provides an easy and efficient way to store
// and process a stream of bytes. You can create as many buffers as you
// like (within memory limits), and then use this common set of functions
// to access each buffer. The buffers are designed for FIFO operation
// (first in, first out). This means that the first byte you put in the
// buffer will be the first one you get when you read out the buffer. Supported
// functions include buffer initialize, get byte from front of buffer, add
// byte to end of buffer, check if buffer is full, and flush buffer. The
// buffer uses a circular design so no copying of data is ever necessary.
// This buffer is not dynamically allocated, it has a user_defined fixed
// maximum size. This buffer is used in many places in the avrlib code.
